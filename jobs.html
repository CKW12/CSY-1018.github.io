  <h1> Comparison of the 3 jobs </h1>
  <h2> These 3 jobs are highly respected roles in the cyber world. Each one of them you need to be experience and passionate about technology and the online
  atmosphere. All three jobs you will need some experience with a select number of different programming languages such as C/C++ and Java. All 3 jobs are highly
  paid as they carry alot of responsibilty as they all comply with similar standards as you are protecting customers personal information. <br><br>
  Each job you will need a relevant degree as you will need some relevant experience and knowledge on what to do as starting from scratch having to learn all of
  the terminology would take a long time to start. Employers will look for specific characteristics in the employee such as loyability and trust worthiness as
  they will need to be entrusted with very important client information. This could include customers bank/payment details therefore it is very important that
  the employee is trust worthy in all of the above jobs.<br><br>
  Through all jobs you will need to be able to protect information, you will need to be attentive to detail as if someone was trying to breach the system you will
  need to isolate the attempt and block their entrance. All jobs will need the employee to block any flaws in their system and be able to report it and explain and
  test the solution you have created. Each job you will need to report your findings to somebody and you will need to be clear and confident as you could be needed
  to teach others how you operate so they understand your methods.<br><br>
  All employees must be able to react under pressure this is due to hackers. If they were to try and enter the system you will need to be on hand to prevent the
  system breach. Also due to customer information it would be a real issue if that information was to get stolen as you would be in breach of the data protection
  act as it states that any personal information must be kept safe.</h2>
